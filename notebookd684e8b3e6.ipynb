This will allow us to ask questions about our documents (that were not included in the training data), without fine-tunning the Large Language Model (LLM).\nWhen using RAG, if you are given a question, you first do a retrieval step to fetch any relevant documents from a special database, a vector database where these documents were indexed. \n\n## Definitions\n\n* LLM - Large Language Model  \n* Llama 2.0 - LLM from Meta \n* Langchain - a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs\n* Vector database - a database that organizes data through high-dimmensional vectors  \n* ChromaDB - vector database  \n* RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation (see below more details about RAGs)\n\n## Model details\n\n* **Model**: Llama 2  \n* **Variation**: 7b-chat-hf  (7b: 7B dimm. hf: HuggingFace build)\n* **Version**: V1  \n* **Framework**: PyTorch  \n\nLlaMA 2 model is pretrained and fine-tuned with 2 Trillion tokens and 7 to 70 Billion parameters which makes it one of the powerful open source models. It is a highly improvement over LlaMA 1 model.\n\n\n## What is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system?\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) has proven their ability to understand context and provide accurate answers to various NLP tasks, including summarization, Q&A, when prompted. While being able to provide very good answers to questions about information that they were trained with, they tend to hallucinate when the topic is about information that they do \"not know\", i.e. was not included in their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation combines external resources with LLMs. The main two components of a RAG are therefore a retriever and a generator.  \n \nThe retriever part can be described as a system that is able to encode our data so that can be easily retrieved the relevant parts of it upon queriying it. The encoding is done using text embeddings, i.e. a model trained to create a vector representation of the information. The best option for implementing a retriever is a vector database. As vector database, there are multiple options, both open source or commercial products. Few examples are ChromaDB, Mevius, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate. Our option in this Notebook will be a local instance of ChromaDB (persistent).\n\nFor the generator part, the obvious option is a LLM. In this Notebook we will use a quantized LLaMA v2 model, from the Kaggle Models collection.  \n\nThe orchestration of the retriever and generator will be done using Langchain. A specialized function from Langchain allows us to create the receiver-generator in one line of code.\n\n## More about this  \n\nDo you want to learn more?
